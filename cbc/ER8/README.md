* H1L1-HOFT_C00_ER8A_CBC.xml contains DQ for C00 data from August 17th 15:00 UTC - September 12th 00:00 UTC (1123858817 - 1126051217)
* H1L1-HOFT_C00_ER8B_CBC.xml contains DQ for C00 data from September 12th 00:00 UTC - September 26th 03:00 UTC (1126051217 - 1127271617)
* H1L1-HOFT_C00_ER8B_16DAY_BACKGROUND_CBC.xml conatins DQ for C00 data from September 12th 00:00 UTC - 20th Oct 13:30 UTC (1126051217 - 1129383017). This veto-definer contains the original flags for the first 5 days as were used in the intial analysis of ER8B. Subsequent flags which were added for the extra 10 days of analysis only start after 26th Sept 03:00 UTC. The original DQ for the first 5 days is preserved. 
* H1L1-HOFT_C01_ER8B_CBC.xml contains DQ for C01 data from September 12th 00:00 UTC - September 26th 03:00 UTC (1126051217 - 1127271617). Note there is a flag int his veto-definer specific to a omicron gating run. If you are not running with this then please contact CBC DQ for a difference version of this veto-definer.
* H1L1-HOFT_C01_ER8B_16DAY_BACKGROUND_CBC.xml contains DQ for the combined C00 and C01 data from September 12th 00:00 UTC - 20th Oct 13:30 UTC (1126051217 - 1129383017). This veto-definer contains the original flags for the first 5 days as were used in the intial analysis of ER8B, with the exception of one. Another flag specific to C00 vetoed 8 seconds of bad data in ER8B, so another flag had to start earlier to capture this behaviour. But this will give us the same DQ flags as should be active during ER8B. Subsequent flags which were added for the extra 10 days of analysis only start after 26th Sept 03:00 UTC. The original DQ for the first 5 days is preserved.
* H1L1-HOFT_C00_ER8B_16DAY_BACKGROUND_NO_DQ_CBC.xml contains basic DQ for C00 data from September 12th 00:00 UTC - 20th Oct 13:30 UTC (1126051217 - 1129383017). This veto-definer is meant to serve as a test of what applying no vetoes to the search does.
