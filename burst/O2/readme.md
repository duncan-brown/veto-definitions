ER10 is covered under veto definers in addition to O2 proper.
Most burst analyses should use H1L1-HOFT_C0?_O2_BURST.xml
Analyses using very low frequencies (the intermediate mass binary black hole search) should use H1L1-HOFT_C0?_O2_BURST_IMBH.xml
Analyses analyzing high frequencies (above 3 kHz) should use H1L1-HOFT_C0?_O2_BURST_HF.xml
